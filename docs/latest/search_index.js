A unitID column is added to represent each unit's unique identifier\npoints: DataFrame, where rows correspond to plotted point dimensions and columns correspond to units of analysis\npointsHat: As above, but for approximate dimensions used for measuring model goodness of fit\npointsNodes: As above, but for the optimized node positions along each plotted dimension\naccum: DataFrame, where rows correspond to units of analysis and columns correspond to edges, counting the (normalized) number of connections that unit accumulated for that edge\naccumHat: As above, but for the approximated counts, used for measuring model goodness of fit\nedges: DataFrame, where rows correspond to edges, with the following columns: edgeID, kind, ground, and response\nnodes: DataFrame, where rows correspond to nodes and columns correspond to approximated counts for each edge, used for computing pointsNodes\nembedding: DataFrame, where rows correspond to plotted point dimensions and columns correspond edges.

It's good to compare these to the overall mean\nAnd the last subplots show how each pair of subgroups compare. Similar to the trend plots, these show you what is being modeled by the difference of the two groups\n\nSome differences from WebENA and rENA:\n\nSaturation shows correlation strength. In WebENA and rENA saturation and line thickness both show magnitude of an effect\nPlots are mean centered by moving the origin of the plot, not by changing the underlying data. This preserves information that may or may not be useful for downstream analyses\nPlots are opinionated. Based on the model config, the plot's default settings to change to what I believed was the best way to plot that kind of model. This gives you the \"right\" plot without having to specify what \"right\" means each time\nA known issue is that the y-axis label can get cutoff when there are a lot of subplots\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl","page":"Home","title":"EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: \"Buy Me A Coffee\")","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: ColPrac: Contributor's Guide on Collaborative Practices for Community Packages)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Author: Mariah A.
