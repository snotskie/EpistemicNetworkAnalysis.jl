If you are coming up with the name of an axis after-the-fact, it&#39;s good to check your assumptions against these trends and make sure your name for the plot captures what is actually being modeled. If all the lines look grey, then it&#39;s hard to succinctly say <em>what</em> is being modeled on an axis</li><li>Subsequent subplots show each subgroup on its own. It&#39;s good to compare these to the overall mean</li><li>And the last subplots show how each pair of subgroups compare.

In WebENA and rENA saturation is redundant (not necessarily bad) with line thickness, which shows magnitude of an effect</li><li>Plots are mean centered by moving the mean of the plot, not by changing the underlying data. This preserves information that may or may not be useful for downstream analyses</li><li>Plots are opinionated.

The ENA process as a whole has five steps:</p><ol><li>Accumulate connection counts between qualitative codes over a sliding window. This gives a high dimensional matrix representation of one&#39;s discourse</li><li>Embed a network into that space as a way to approximately understand how the model weights change as one moves through the space</li><li>Reduce the dimensionality of that space to highlight one&#39;s features of interest. This is called dimension reduction, multidimensional scaling, or rigid body rotation in QE-land</li><li>Visualize that reduced space</li><li>Interpret the results</li></ol><p>All these steps are agnostic to your sense of your narrative structure, except for the third, the dimension reduction step. It&#39;s in that step that the algorithm chooses which information to show and which to hide. Ideally, your dimension reduction lets you think on the plot the same way you think on the page‚Äîover here is this, and over here is this‚Äî, letting you (a) move through the story as feels natural while (b) retaining exactly the information you need to tell and test that kind of story</p><p>Our sense of our story should <em>drive</em> our ENA models.

Use this to get a high level view of your data. A <em>really</em> good place to start. Rarely the best place to stop</li><li><code>MeansRotation</code>: Use this to compare exactly two groups. Use this to compare exactly two groups that are each divisible into exactly two sub-groups</li><li><code>MulticlassRotation</code> and <code>LDARotation</code>: Use these to compare multiple groups. When you have a continuous variable, it&#39;s likely that your story still moves over discrete touchpoints, eg., low-scoring students, early days in the year, etc. Let your sense of your story guide how you split up your data into groups, then compare those groups</li><li><code>TopicRotation</code>: Use this to check prior theory, or your own inferences, about how codes will affect a model. We do a lot of thinking from our inferences about what a model is capturing. This rotation lets you make that thinking explicit</li><li><code>FormulaRotation</code>: My feelings on this are similar to SVD. It&#39;s probably a good place to start, to see how your data compares to some variable. Pair it with a <code>spectralColorBy</code>. But it also probably isn&#39;t a good place to end, since linear regressions likely don&#39;t fit how we structure our tellings of the story. Even so, this rotation is incredibly flexible, so it can be a good starting point for creating other rotations</li><li><code>TrainedRotation</code>: Use this when you need to test a different rotation against a holdout test or validation set. It isn&#39;t a rotation in itself, but instead a useful piece of ENA machinery for perform certain kinds of model validity checks</li></ul><div class="admonition is-category-checkin"><header class="admonition-header">Checkin</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>Is there anything you would like me to review again or cover before we move on to getting help after the conference?</p></div></div><h2 id="Getting-Help-and-Contributing"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Getting-Help-and-Contributing">Getting Help and Contributing</a><a id="Getting-Help-and-Contributing-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Getting-Help-and-Contributing" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p><code>EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl</code> lives on <a href="https://github.com/snotskie/EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl">GitHub</a></p><p>But not just that package.
