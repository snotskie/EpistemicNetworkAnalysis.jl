All of Julia lives on GitHub. Every Julia package, and even the language itself, by design are hosted on GitHub. This can make things difficult for people living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_GitHub">some countries where GitHub is occasionally blocked or slowed</a>. By and far though, this allows you to:</p><ul><li>See and report issues for all Julia packages, as well as propose your own fixes</li><li>See the entire history of development and discussion for all Julia packages</li><li>Easily find documentation for most Julia packages</li><li>Engage in discussion with other users of some of your favorite packages</li><li>Directly ask developers for help</li></ul><p>Julia has from the very beginning made open source development a part of how the language itself works. I really appreciate this because it builds community right into everything I do. You never code alone, and you never learn to code alone</p><p>While Julia takes this to the limit, other QE resources are open to some extent:</p><ul><li>rENA lets you see issues and development history on <a href="https://gitlab.com/epistemic-analytics/qe-packages/rENA/-/issues">gitlab</a></li><li>Several workshops shared on <a href="https://qesoc.org/">qesoc</a> via Google Drive:<ul><li>ROCK</li><li>Intro to ENA</li><li>Advanced ENA</li><li>rENA</li><li>Intro to Automated Coding</li></ul></li></ul><p>Those workshops are <em>not</em> shared open source in the same sense as GitHub and gitlab, in that we can&#39;t provide feedback, suggest changes, ask questions, or review histories</p><p>Activity:</p><ol><li>Summarize with your neighbor in 10 words or less: What do we care about when we talk about <em>open source</em> research software?</li><li>What other QE open resources am I missing?

If you have <code>:Hello</code> in five places in your code, they always resolve to the exact same thing in memory. It is the name for the exact same concrete label. But if you have <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code> in five places, those could resolve to five different things in memory, like having five people named <code>&quot;David&quot;</code> at the same meeting</p><p>Arrays in Julia work similar to Python, with one main difference:</p><ul><li><code>a = [1, 2, 3]</code> creates an array</li><li><code>a[1]</code> is the <em>first</em> item in the array, like in R</li></ul><p>Julia has four consoles in a single REPL:</p><ul><li><code>;</code> brings up the shell console</li><li><code>?</code> brings up the help console</li><li><code>]</code> brings up the package console</li><li>and backspacing takes you back to the main console</li></ul><p>We&#39;ll use the main console and the help console the most</p><p>Julia has robust type and package systems.

If you are coming up with the name of an axis after-the-fact, it&#39;s good to check your assumptions against these trends and make sure your name for the plot captures what is actually being modeled. If all the lines look grey, then it&#39;s hard to succinctly say <em>what</em> is being modeled on an axis: there&#39;s just a lot of noise</li><li>Subsequent subplots show each subgroup on its own. It&#39;s good to compare these to the overall mean</li><li>And the last subplots show how each pair of subgroups compare. Similar to the trend plots, these show you <em>what</em> is being modeled by the difference of the two groups. If everything looks grey, then it&#39;s hard to give a succinct description of that difference: there&#39;s just a lot of noise</li></ul><p>Some differences from WebENA and rENA:</p><ul><li>Saturation shows <em>correlation strength</em> so we can tell at a glance when a model might be weak. In WebENA and rENA saturation is redundant (not necessarily bad) with line thickness, which shows magnitude of an effect</li><li>Plots are mean centered by moving the mean of the plot, not by changing the underlying data. This preserves information that may or may not be useful for downstream analyses</li><li>Plots are opinionated. Based on the model type, rotation type, and config, <em>I</em>, Mariah Knowles specifically, made the call for what the best way to plot that model is and made it the default. These defaults were chosen to be predictable and based only on the details you explicitly say yourself when you setup your model. This gives you the &quot;right&quot; plot without having to specify what &quot;right&quot; means each time</li><li>A <a href="https://github.com/snotskie/EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl/issues/11">known issue</a> is that the y-axis label can get cutoff when there are a lot of subplots</li></ul><p>There are a lot of arguments for tweaking the default plot. For info on these, check the help text on <code>EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.plot</code> or <a href="../plots/">read the plot documentation</a></p><p>Some other useful functions, we can export an ENA model to a spreadsheet, we can save our plots to many image formats, and we can load in our own data from a CSV file:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">to_xlsx(&quot;example.xlsx&quot;, model)

It&#39;s in that step that the algorithm chooses which information to show and which to hide. Ideally, your dimension reduction lets you think on the plot the same way you think on the page&amp;mdash;over here is this, and over here is this&amp;mdash;, letting you (a) move through the story as feels natural while (b) retaining exactly the information you need to tell and test that kind of story</p><p><strong>Want a high-level view of your data?</strong></p><p>You need to see the most &quot;stuff&quot; of your story</p><p>You probably don&#39;t have a strong sense of a narrative structure just yet</p><p>Use <code>SVDRotation</code>, captures the most variance, captures the most &quot;stuff,&quot; plot is the most likely to be legible at a glance</p><p><strong>Want to compare groups?</strong></p><p>You need to see what makes groups different from each other, and everything else is beside the point</p><p>If you have two groups, your story likely looks like a Venn diagram: Here&#39;s what group A has, here&#39;s what group B has, and here&#39;s what they have in common</p><p>Use a <code>MeansRotation</code> in that case, captures the most between-group variance, plot places the group means right on the x-axis</p><p>If you have more then two groups, then there&#39;s a few options.</p><p>If your groups have an innate order to them, like months in a year or phases of an intervention, then I&#39;d like to sit down with you! I haven&#39;t found a convincing way to model these just yet</p><p>If your groups lack any innate order, like schools in a district, then your narrative structure might be hard to intuit. There&#39;s lots of ways to compare multiple groups! I recommend a &quot;themes of difference&quot; approach, where each paragraph is one theme that captures a lot of what makes multiple groups differ from one another</p><p>Use <code>MulticlassRotation</code> or <code>LDARotation</code>. <code>MulticlassRotation</code> retains more variance, so plots tend to be more legible and interpretable. <code>LDARotation</code> focuses on discrimination between groups, so it could be useful if you have downstream predictive analysis you want to run</p><p><strong>Want to relate your model to continuous variables?</strong></p><p>Like time, test scores, etc.</p><p>You need to see how the qualities of your discourse covary with your continuous variable, and everything else is beside the point</p><p>Your narrative structure probably moves through touch points in your continuous variable, such as low scores, medium scores, and high scores</p><p>If there is a well-definedc and meaningful way to split your continuous variable into discrete groups, then consider telling your story by just comparing those groups</p><p>If there aren&#39;t great ways to split your continuous variable into discrete groups, then consider using high dimensional clustering techniques to define groups of similar points, then tell the story that compares those groups</p><p>Otherwise, if you just want to see a general trend of &quot;high scores are like this&quot; and &quot;low scores are like this,&quot; possibly controlling for confounding variables or nested data, then use a <code>FormulaRotation</code></p><p><code>FormulaRotation</code> fits a linear regression to each dimension of the high dimensional space and uses that to find a trend line or &quot;slope,&quot; which it runs the x-axis through.
