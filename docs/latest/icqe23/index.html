# Run the model and plot it

p = plot(model)
display(p)</code></pre><p><strong>Plot Interpretation</strong></p><p><code>plot(model)</code> produces a plot with the following subplots:</p><ul><li><code>(a)</code> an overall mean, which tells us the baseline everything compares against</li><li><code>(b)</code> and <code>(c)</code> rates of change for each connection across the x- and y-axes, which tells us what is <em>actually</em> being modeled by each axis. If you are coming up with the name of an axis after-the-fact, it&#39;s good to check your assumptions against these trends and make sure your name for the plot captures what is actually being modeled. If all the lines look grey, then it&#39;s hard to succinctly say <em>what</em> is being modeled on an axis: there&#39;s just a lot of noise</li><li>Subsequent subplots show each subgroup on its own. It&#39;s good to compare these to the overall mean</li><li>And the last subplots show how each pair of subgroups compare. Similar to the trend plots, these show you <em>what</em> is being modeled by the difference of the two groups. If everything looks grey, then it&#39;s hard to give a succinct description of that difference: there&#39;s just a lot of noise</li></ul><p>Some differences from WebENA and rENA:</p><ul><li>Saturation shows <em>correlation strength</em> so we can tell at a glance when a model might be weak. In WebENA and rENA saturation is redundant (not necessarily bad) with line thickness, which shows magnitude of an effect</li><li>Plots are mean centered by moving the mean of the plot, not by changing the underlying data. This preserves information that may or may not be useful for downstream analyses</li><li>Plots are opinionated. Based on the model config, the plot&#39;s default settings to change to what I believed was the best way to plot that kind of model. This gives you the &quot;right&quot; plot without having to specify what &quot;right&quot; means each time</li><li>A <a href="https://github.com/snotskie/EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl/issues/11">known issue</a> is that the y-axis label can get cutoff when there are a lot of subplots</li></ul><p><strong>Conversation, Window Size, and Empty Units</strong></p><p>As is, each day is its own &quot;conversation,&quot; meaning no connections are made from day to day. Instead, lets change the conversation to the whole year:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">conversations = [:All] # :All is a column we made that just contains the word &quot;All&quot;</code></pre><p>That&#39;s better, I guess. But let&#39;s inspect the model to see what&#39;s going on:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">display(model)</code></pre><p>Notice this part of the output:</p><pre><code class="language-txt hljs"> ModelConfig =
     (codes = [:DoseTracking,
               :SkippedDose,
               :Happy,
               :NonHappy,
               :Sweets,
               :BODY,
               :REFLECT,
               :LEARN,
               :PROGRESS],
      conversations = [:All],
      units = [:Date],
      unitFilter = ...,
      edgeFilter = ...,
      windowSize = Inf, &lt;--- This part right here
      sphereNormalize = true,
      dropEmpty = false,
      recenterEmpty = false),</code></pre><p>By default, the window size in this package is infinite, meaning any connection between any codes in the whole conversation are counted. Let&#39;s pick a more sensible window:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">model = ENAModel(
    data, codes, conversations, units,
    windowSize=4
)</code></pre><p>Much better. One more tweak. Let&#39;s tell the model what to do with empty units. David&#39;s convinced me that the best place to put them is in the mean or center of the plot. This has advantages for proper stats tests later</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">model = ENAModel(
    data, codes, conversations, units,
    windowSize=4,
    recenterEmpty=true
)</code></pre><p><strong>Plot Tweaks</strong></p><p>This is data that moves over time. And other projects I know have data that moves over different continuous variables, like grades or so on. Let&#39;s color code our plot to make that pop:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">p = plot(
    model,
    spectralColorBy=true
)</code></pre><p>Alternatively, we could split the year&#39;s data in half and color code by that instead:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">p = plot(
    model,
    groupBy=:Half # :Half is a column we added that says &quot;First&quot; then &quot;Second&quot;
)</code></pre><p>Or we could split it in thirds (<code>groupBy=:Third</code>) or in fourths (<code>groupBy=:Fourth</code>)</p><p>Activity:</p><ul><li>Which version of the plot shows the most information?</li><li>What &quot;story&quot; are you starting to see emerge about the data from that year?</li></ul><p><strong>Rotations</strong></p><p>The first and second halves seem different. Let&#39;s rotate the model to make that the focus:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">rotation = MeansRotation(:Half, &quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;)
model = ENAModel(
    data, codes, conversations, units,
    windowSize=4,
    recenterEmpty=true,
    rotateBy=rotation
)</code></pre><p>Surely though, a person&#39;s experience over a year can&#39;t be summed up as just a before and an after, right? Let&#39;s split the year in thirds and make that three-way difference the focus:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">rotation = MulticlassRotation(:Third)</code></pre><p>Note the test statistic for the x- and y-axes:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">display(model.embedding[1, :KruskalWallis_H])
display(model.embedding[2, :KruskalWallis_H])</code></pre><p>If we <em>really</em> want to pull the groups apart and maximize that statistic, we can use a slightly different rotation:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">rotation = LDARotation(:Third)</code></pre><p>Note the drop in the variance explained. The plot is also hard to read, so let&#39;s zoom in:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">p = plot(
    model,
    zoom=3
)</code></pre><p>Activity:</p><ul><li>Which of those two models (Multiclass or LDA) do you prefer and why?</li></ul><p>Let&#39;s try splitting the year in fourth next:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">rotation = MulticlassRotation(:Fourth)
# or
rotation = LDARotation(:Fourth)</code></pre><p>Wow, that&#39;s a lot of subplots. Let&#39;s pull out just one for now:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">sp = plot(p.subplots[1], size=(600,600))
display(sp)</code></pre><p>Activity:</p><ul><li>We&#39;ve seen this data modeled a lot of different ways now. Which codes seem to really be driving the story the most?</li></ul><p>Let&#39;s model that assumption directly:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">rotation = TopicRotation(&quot;HRT?&quot;, [:SkippedDose], [:Happy])
# ...
p = plot(
    model,
    spectralColorBy=true
)
# or
p = plot(
    model,
    groupBy=:Fourth
)</code></pre><p>That seems to be pretty close. The spectral plot still has a lot of red in the middle though. Being familiar with this data, and having lived it, I know that there&#39;s a little more to the story than just those two codes</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">rotation = TopicRotation(&quot;HRT&quot;, [:SkippedDose, :DoseTracking], [:Happy, :PROGRESS])</code></pre><p>Much better</p><p>That was all a lot of work. What if we just wanted to ask, show me the model that focuses on time as a linear scale?</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">using Pkg
Pkg.add(&quot;GLM&quot;)
using GLM
# ...
rotation = FormulaRotation(
    LinearModel, @formula(y ~ 1 + Day), 2, nothing
)</code></pre><p><strong>Exporting Results and Importing your own Data</strong></p><p>Two useful functions for exporting your results are <code>to_xlsx</code> and <code>savefig</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">to_xlsx(&quot;example.xlsx&quot;, model)

using Plots
p = plot(model)
savefig(p, &quot;example.png&quot;)</code></pre><p>We use <code>loadExample</code> to load one of the pre-baked example datasets. To load your own data, you use the <code>DataFrames</code> and <code>CSV</code> packages:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">using DataFrames
using CSV
data = DataFrame(CSV.File(&quot;example.csv&quot;))</code></pre><p>Remember, you may first have to add these packages with <code>Pkg.add(&quot;Plots&quot;)</code> etc.</p><h2 id="Choosing-Models"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Choosing-Models">Choosing Models</a><a id="Choosing-Models-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Choosing-Models" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>A big part of choosing the right model is telling stories</p><p>Activity:</p><ol><li>Pair up. Pick your favorite version of the model we&#39;ve run so far and use it to write a summary of the year&#39;s data, in less than 80 words</li><li>Whose story is the right version of the story to tell? Is yours the right version of the story to tell? How would you even judge that?</li><li>This data is about me. If I told you your telling of the story felt weird to me, would that affect your answer?</li><li>Did your model affect the way you structured your story? How so?</li></ol><p>Here we made the model first and told the story second. Let&#39;s try it the other way</p><p>Activity:</p><ol><li>Put the image below on the board</li><li>Split the group in half: ethnographers and ethnographers-of-ethnographers</li><li>Ethnographers: How would you describe this image? Discuss and put sticky note labels right on the TV. Label everything you see</li><li>E-o-Es: Watch their discussion and take notes</li><li>When done, take the image away, leaving just the stickies</li><li>E-o-Es: What did you observe and what do you see going on up here?</li><li>Ethnographers: Watch their discussion and take notes</li><li>When done, Ethnographers: What did you observe?</li></ol><p><img src="../map-capture.png" alt/></p><p>Stories have structure, and these structures have a geometry to them:</p><ul><li>We talk about some set of events because they share some sense of similarity</li><li>We move onto the next paragraph where we talk about a different set of events sharing a different similarity</li><li>And we hang those paragraphs together into a larger narrative structure</li><li>These narratives have a geometry to them: over here is this, and over here is this, and here&#39;s how the qualities change as we move around from point to point, from paragraph to paragraph</li></ul><p>ENA helps us capture that geometry. The ENA process as a whole has five steps:</p><ol><li>Accumulate connection counts between qualitative codes over a sliding window. This gives a high dimensional matrix representation of one&#39;s discourse</li><li>Embed a network into that space as a way to approximately understand how the model weights change as one moves through the space</li><li>Reduce the dimensionality of that space to highlight one&#39;s features of interest. This is called dimension reduction, multidimensional scaling, or rigid body rotation in QE-land</li><li>Visualize that reduced space</li><li>Interpret the results</li></ol><p>All these steps are agnostic to your sense of your narrative structure, except for the third, the dimension reduction step. It&#39;s in that step that the algorithm chooses which information to show and which to hide. Ideally, your dimension reduction lets you think on the plot the same way you think on the page&amp;mdash;over here is this, and over here is this&amp;mdash;, letting you (a) move through the story as feels natural while (b) retaining exactly the information you need to tell and test that kind of story</p><p>Our sense of our story should <em>drive</em> our ENA models. And when the two conflict, we should figure out why and extend ENA to fit</p><p>To get us started, I&#39;ve tried to build into <code>EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl</code> enough rotations that I believe are flexible enough to handle the bulk of cases</p><ul><li><code>SVDRotation</code>: The default. Use this to get a high level view of your data. A <em>really</em> good place to start. Rarely the best place to stop</li><li><code>MeansRotation</code>: Use this to compare exactly two groups. Use this to compare exactly two groups that are each divisible into exactly two sub-groups</li><li><code>MulticlassRotation</code> and <code>LDARotation</code>: Use these to compare multiple groups. When you have a continuous variable, it&#39;s likely that your story still moves over discrete touchpoints, eg., low-scoring students, early days in the year, etc. Let your sense of your story guide how you split up your data into groups, then compare those groups</li><li><code>TopicRotation</code>: Use this to check prior theory, or your own inferences, about how codes will affect a model. We do a lot of thinking from our inferences about what a model is capturing. This rotation lets you make that thinking explicit</li><li><code>FormulaRotation</code>: My feelings on this are similar to SVD. It&#39;s probably a good place to start, to see how your data compares to some variable. Pair it with a <code>spectralColorBy</code>. But it also probably isn&#39;t a good place to end, since linear regressions likely don&#39;t fit how we structure our tellings of the story. Even so, this rotation is incredibly flexible, so it can be a good starting point for creating other rotations</li><li><code>TrainedRotation</code>: Use this when you need to test a different rotation against a holdout test or validation set. It isn&#39;t a rotation in itself, but instead a useful piece of ENA machinery for perform certain kinds of model validity checks</li></ul><h2 id="After-the-Conference:-Support-and-Contributions"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#After-the-Conference:-Support-and-Contributions">After the Conference: Support and Contributions</a><a id="After-the-Conference:-Support-and-Contributions-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#After-the-Conference:-Support-and-Contributions" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p><code>EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl</code> lives on <a href="https://github.com/snotskie/EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl">GitHub</a></p><p>But not just that package. All of Julia lives on GitHub. Every Julia package, and even the language itself, by design are hosted on GitHub. This can make things difficult for people living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_GitHub">some countries where GitHub is occasionally blocked or slowed</a>. By and far though, this allows you to:</p><ul><li>See and report issues for all Julia packages, as well as propose your own fixes</li><li>See the entire history of development and discussion for all Julia packages</li><li>Easily find documentation for most Julia packages</li><li>Engage in discussion with other users of some of your favorite packages</li><li>Directly ask developers for help</li></ul><p>Julia also has a <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/">very active and welcoming discussion board</a></p><p>Julia has from the very beginning made open source development a part of how the language itself works. I really appreciate this because it builds community right into everything I do with it. You never code alone, and you never learn to code alone</p><p>While Julia takes this to the limit, other QE resources are also open to varying extents:</p><ul><li>rENA lets you see issues and development history on <a href="https://gitlab.com/epistemic-analytics/qe-packages/rENA/-/issues">gitlab</a></li><li>Several workshops shared on <a href="https://qesoc.org/">qesoc</a> via Google Drive:<ul><li>ROCK workshop</li><li>Intro to ENA workshop</li><li>Advanced ENA workshop</li><li>rENA workshop</li><li>Intro to Automated Coding workshop</li></ul></li></ul><p>Activity:</p><ol><li>Summarize with your neighbor in 15 words or less: What does <code>EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl</code> being open source mean to you?</li><li>What other QE open resources am I missing? Other not-specifically-QE-but-still-useful open resources?</li><li>What are you planning to do with ENA and ENA tools like <code>EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl</code> in the future? What kind of support or community would best help you on that?</li></ol><h2 id="Closeout"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Closeout">Closeout</a><a id="Closeout-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Closeout" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Before we leave, let&#39;s plan some future activities:</p><ul><li><strong>Users:</strong> If you are primarily planning on <em>using</em> <code>EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl</code> or tools like it, not <em>developing</em> new tools or extensions to them, schedule a post-conference check-in with me (TODO) to see how you&#39;re doing and help you along with your projects</li><li><strong>Developers:</strong> If you are planning on developing extensions to <code>EpistemicNetworkAnalysis.jl</code> or writing other tools like it, vote on a meetup time (TODO) for developers to get together and share what we&#39;re thinking and working on</li></ul><p>Finally, thank you so so much!
