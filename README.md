## Recommended Citation

If you use this Julia implementation of ENA in your research, please cite it, the Julia language, and the R version it is based on, as shown below; describe it as "...an experimental port of ENA from the original R to Julia (Bezanson et al, 2017; Knowles, 2021; Marquart et al 2019)"; and justify your choice of Julia over R. For example, your research team may be more familiar with Julia or you may need interoperability with other existing Julia libraries.
